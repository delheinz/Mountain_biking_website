<h1>Mountain Biking</h1>
    <p> Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough 
    terrain. This sport requires endurance, core and back strength, balance, bike
    handling skills, and self-reliance. Mountain bikers usually use specially
    designed mountain bikes, which incorporate features designed to enhance
    durability and performance in rough terrain. Let's take a loot at them.</p>

<h2>Types of mountain bikes</h2>
    <p>It's important to understand the basics of mountain bike design and know your own riding style,
        ability, and the kinds of trails you will be spending most of your time on. These are the four
        most common types of mountain biking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cross-Country</li>
        <li>Trail</li>
        <li>All Mountain</li>
        <li>Downhill</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each type requires different features in a bike that satisfy the kind of exercise the riders'
        want to perform.</p>

<p class="conclussion">
It’s easy to obsess over every measurement and component of different models of mountain bikes when looking at them
 on a computer screen, but there is absolutely no substitute for some real time in the saddle. So, once you’ve
  narrowed down the candidates and you’re ready to choose your next mountain bike, it’s time to do some riding.
   Demoing a mountain bike is the only true way to get a feel for how it rides, and how it suits you. Each unique 
   combination of geometry, design, and build gives a bike different characteristics that suit different riders 
   best. Find what works for you!
